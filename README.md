 PROJECT-
 # Catering Reservation and food ordering system college ranker project
 
Catering is a website that allows counter developers to promote and sell their catering. Rural towns would be able to sell their commodities to the rest of the globe as a result of this. The goal of this project is to establish a portal that will allow users to buy catering from the admin and change product information securely using a mobile device. Catering is given priority in order to allow them to develop their skills and promote our traditional Indian culture.
